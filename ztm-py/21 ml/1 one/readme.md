* important steps for machine learning

        1 Import data
        2 clean the data 
        3 split data Training set / Test set
        4 create a model 
        5 check the output
        6 improve


* tools for machine learning:
        
        numpy :
        its the library that help us to use list and arrays in python 
        
        pandas :
        it use for data analysis

        scikit learn :
        it is helpful in the creating model part, it comes with the different algorithems

        matplotlib :
        its a charting library, it helps us to visualized the data in any way we want

        jupyter notebooks :
        it helps to analyses through steps of our program 
        we can install notebook by this command : pip install notebook
        to run the notebook you can use this : jupyter notebook

        kaggle :
        its community and it also has data sets
