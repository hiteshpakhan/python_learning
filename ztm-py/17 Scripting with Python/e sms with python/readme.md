* mail from teilio:




        We have detected that your Twilio API credentials have been compromised and have automatically revoked them to protect your account from unauthorized access.

        We have discovered that the Auth Token belonging to Account SID ACceea98b33845c6e787802ecc3f38077c is publicly available at:

        https://github.com/hiteshpakhan/python_learning/blob/e6cb2cdb0994690ddaad1e67731f017237308984/ztm-py/17 Scripting with Python/e sms with python/main.py

        Since your Auth Token has been rotated, your application will no longer function and you must replace your old Auth Token with your new one, which you can find on the Console: https://www.twilio.com/console

        In the future, please make sure you are following development best practices and taking the proper steps to store your Twilio credentials securely.
